    "# Scraping salary data for veterinary clinical pathologists from Glassdoor\n",
    "My wife is a veterinary clinical pathologist and is very interested in determining the range of salaries for her profession. One way of doing that is webscraping to aquire a large enough dataset to identify trends, such as salary by city/state or by foci. Glassdoor is a good resource for this, as it is widely used and I can easily shift keywords to search for broader categories to compare. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I will attempt to pool together some code to generate a dataframe to analyze. For data collection, I will use a webscraping approach through Glassdoor using code prepared by Omer Sakarya (https://github.com/arapfaik/scraping-glassdoor-selenium). I only slightly modified the data and plan on forking it off from github."
