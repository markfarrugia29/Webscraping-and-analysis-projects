    "* **Size** - The largest company bin (10000+ employeers) comprises the bulk of the postings, followed by small enterprises (200-500 employees)\n",
    "* **Ownership** - Private and publicly held companies have the highest postings for data analysts. Surprisingly, government and university jobs dont have very many postings. For universities this is especially surprising, as there are ample opportunities to look at large data sets to determine student success or happiness. \n",
    "* **Industry** - Human Resources, Insurance, Healthcare and Business consulting top the list for industries with data analyst job postings on Glassdoor. Surprisingly, biotech is at the low end of the list. Maybe this is due to data analytics being lumped in with the duties of a research scientist. One thing to note is the **broad** range of industries needing data analyst services. Even in this small sample set, **37** different represented industries are observed!\n",
    "* **Revenue** The Revenue ranges given are roughly equivalent to each other in terms of representation. A good portion of the postings did not have an annual revenue, so perhaps supplimenting this data with a seperate datasource would be helpful if we wish to analyze based off revenue further. \n",
    "* **Location - city** - Large cities hold the most postings for data analysts, with New York topping the list. Surprisingly, remote jobs are the largest posting type! Good for people who have the skills but don't wish to change locations. \n",
    "* **Location - state** - Again, the bulk of locations are remote, with New York state holding the most postings after that. I was surprised to see California and Washington not represented more heavily, but perhaps those postings were listed as remote since they have more experience with that work being farmed out. A question to follow up with later. \n",
    "* **Seniority level** - Junior and senior positions based on text scraping are equally represented, but I need to go back and tweek the code to strip out I/II/III from the data and bin them into the appropriate seniority levels. As it stands, I won't be able to get very much out of this. "

    "A ton of quick insights from this pivot table dump. Unsurprisingly, senior analysts make significantly more than juniors ($102k vs $69k average). Business/Cybersecurity analysts top the list of salary ranges. Smaller companies (defined as 1-200, 500-5000 employees) pay on the lower end of salaries, with 200-500 employee companies being the outlier at the higher end. It would be interesting to see if 200-500 employee companies are requesting more senior/cybersecurity jobs, which skew the average up. Public companies and government jobs pay the highst on average, with university/non-provig being the lowest. Security and HR are on the higher end as well, with biotech, grocery and universities being the bototm. Lastly, the Real Estate, IT and Government sectors are the high end of salaries.\n",

    "The data bins could us esome work, specifically the title grouping. It would also be nice to have a large dataset to take care of data skewing (such as having states with 1 high job posting skewing results). I could clean the data further by removing states with a single job count ooff the lst. For now, this will work as a launchpad to make some quick ML models for correlation predictions. "
